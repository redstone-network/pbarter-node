//! # Offchain Worker Example Pallet
//!
//! The Offchain Worker Example: A simple pallet demonstrating
//! concepts, APIs and structures common to most offchain workers.
//!
//! Run `cargo doc --package pallet-example-offchain-worker --open` to view this module's
//! documentation.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! **This pallet serves as an example showcasing Substrate off-chain worker and is not meant to
//! be used in production.**
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! In this example we are going to build a very simplistic, naive and definitely NOT
//! production-ready oracle for BTC/USD price.
//! Offchain Worker (OCW) will be triggered after every block, fetch the current price
//! and prepare either signed or unsigned transaction to feed the result back on chain.
//! The on-chain logic will simply aggregate the results and store last `64` values to compute
//! the average price.
//! Additional logic in OCW is put in place to prevent spamming the network with both signed
//! and unsigned transactions, and custom `UnsignedValidator` makes sure that there is only
//! one unsigned transaction floating in the network.
